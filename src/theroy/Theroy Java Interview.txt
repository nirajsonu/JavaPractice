Q)Final vs. Finally vs Finalize?
Ans: Final --> it is used for variable value non-changeable also class is final so not be able to extend base class.
Final and abstract illegal combinations.
Finally --> Used for the cleanup code in exception handling always executes only not execute system.exit(0).
Finalize --> it is used to clean up code call garbage collector.

Q) programs.String vs. StringBuilder vs. programs.String-buffer?
Ans: programs.String --> Immutable non-modifiable data structure.
StringBuilder --> non-Immutable non synchronized (at a time many threads can use)
StringBuffer --> non-Immutable synchronized (at a time one thread can use)

Q) Internal working of hashmap?
Ans: 4 parts current address next address key value
Hashing Function, Bucket Array, hash collisions, load factor.

Q) java 8 enhancements/features?
Ans: Lambda Expressions --> no name no return type function that we replace is functional interface.


Functional interface (Those interfaces which have one abstract method only) @FunctionalInterface
---------------------------
Optional--> class which has one abstract method get() used to handle null values. isPresent() ,ofNullable(),isEmpty
Predicate ---> takes an argument and rerun boolean test()
Function ---> takes an argument and return any primate. apply()
Consumer ---> takes an argument and no return anything accept()
Suppler ---> takes no argument and return a value get()

For two arguments
---------------------
BiPredicate
BiFunction
BiConsumer
BiSuppiler
---------------------------



Stream API --> it is used to process collections, strings,arrays,IntStream
-------------------
Terminal operators
--------------------------
forEach -->similar to for loop for each element.
collect --> for collect toList, toMap, toMap.
reduce ---> takes 2 element and return one element.
toArray --> to convert stream to Array.

short circuit operator
-------------------------
allMatch --> just like regex all match case every element match.
anyMatch --> one match elements.
noneMatch --> non-match elements.
findFirst ---> find a first element of the stream.
findAny ----> find any element.


max ---> find max element of the stream.
min ----> find a min element of the stream.

Intermediate operators
----------------------------
filter --> it accept a predicate for filter data from stream.
map ---> for perform operation each element.
flatMap ---> list of list stream for flatten the operation stream of streams.
district ---> to get non-duplicated elements. order remains the same.
sorted ---> for sorting operations.
peek ----> debugging purpose.
limit ----> similar to sql
skip -----> skip elements.


Downstream collectors.
PartitionBy --> it is used to partition the value to two parts based on predicate.   Collectors.PartitionBy()
Counting --> Collectors.counting()   to count
SummarizingInt --> Collectors.sumSummarizingInt()   --> IntSummaryStatistics. to use sum,avg etc.
mapping --> Collectors.mapping()  -->
joining --> Collectors.joining()  -->
groupingBY --> Collectors.groupBy()  --> it will return a map.
filtering --> terminal operator
collectingAndThen -->
toMap -->
toConcurrentMap -->
reducing -->
faltMapping -->
Collectors.teeing() -->


Why Comparable is not functional interface?
Ans -> becuase it will not convert to lamda expression it relay on object context


Default Methods -->
Method Reference -->

New Date time API
--------------------
LocalDate,LocalDateTime,DateTimeFormatter, ZonedDateTime


Meta Space --> meta-space replace prem gen space
parellelStream().

Q)How to make singleton class
Ans: Only one object for one class whole application override clone method and return null

Q) How many ways to create a thread?
And two ways 1)Extending the thread class
2)Implementation the Runnable interface.
the best way is Implementation runnable interface because you can extend another class.

Q)Interface vs Abstract class?
Ans: Interface -->100% abstract implements
Abstract class -->Abstract or non-Abstract methods. extends

Q) How to make immutable class
And use private constructor, only getter method,declare as final so no inheritance, make all fields final and private.
Example : programs.String,Wrapper class,LocalDate,LocalTime,Instant.

Q)What Synchronize method and synchronize block?
Ans: Synchronize method --> used to allow one thread can run one time
public static synchronized void staticMethod() {
    // Critical section
}
synchronize block --> not block all the method code partially block and lock the object object means any class.clas
 synchronized (ClassName.class) {
        // Critical section
    }

Q)Overloading vs Overriding?
Ans:Overloading --> which same signature but different parameters compile time polymorphism.
Overriding --> which same signature and same parameters.

Q)OOPs concepts 4 pillers?
object-oriented programming language.
Ans: Inheritance: parent class relationship ()
Abstraction:hiding essential information to end user. (Abstract class and interface)
Polymorphism: many forms overriding and overloading date types mm/dd/yyyy yyyy/dd/mm
Encapsulation: warping and putting data in a single unit. private,public,getter and setters
Class and Object
Coupling
Cohesion


Q)Access modifiers type and usage and differences?
Ans:public: Anywhere access in the package and outside the package
private: only inside the class.
protected: Anywhere in package and its kids
abstract

Q) try with resources?
Ans:it is come in java 7 try with not finally block

Q) How much IOC container ?
Ans: Bean Factory : lazy loading only xml
Application context: Eager xml and annotation

Q) throw keyword and throws?
Ans: throw used to throw the exception
throws used to handle exception redirect to immediate parent.

Q) why is java not a fully object-oriented programming language?
Ans: because it supports primitive data

Q) JDK,JRE,JVM?
Ans: JDK -->Tools
JVM --> platform dependent
JRE --> Java run time Environment create a environment to run java file it is used to .class file to .exe file.

Q)Factory vs singleton?
Ans: Factory we give the name of the class and it will create object
Singleton: that is used to create object that will be share whole application.
construct private and public method to create object
Builder pattern : build() method. class and static Builder inner class

Q)Transient keyword?
Ans: to avoid serialization.

Q)Serialization and Externalization?
Ans: Externalization is customizing Serialization.

Q) storage in java?
Ans: Stack will store methods and primitives
Heap: Objects
programs.String pool Area -->
Native Area.
PC register
Static area

Q)HashMap vs. HashTable?
Ans: Hashmap --> performance is good one null key and multiple null values.

Q)What is Memory leak how to avoid it?
Ans: Use try with resources.
Avoid static references
use weak references
graceful error handling
use profiling tools --> jprofiler
optimize jvm parameters.

Q) Reflection and internalization?
Ans:


Q) SSL / TLS application in java?

Java LTS (Long-term support)

Q) Sealed class,records, patten matching in switch,virtual thread,scope values.

Q) Atomic Variable?
Ans:

Q) Deep copy and shallow copy?
Ans:Shallow copy → Copies the object, but references inside still point to the same memory.
    Deep copy → Copies the object and creates new copies of all nested objects, so the entire structure is independent.

Q) Optimistic locking vs Pessimistic locking?
Optimistic locking
No DB lock taken. Uses a version check at commit time. If someone else updated the row, the transaction fails.

Pessimistic locking:
Locks the row immediately (e.g., SELECT FOR UPDATE). Other transactions must wait.

Q) What is Eventual consistency?
Eventual consistency is a consistency model in distributed systems where updates propagate asynchronously to all nodes.
Data may be temporarily inconsistent, but eventually becomes consistent if no new updates occur.

Q)Volatile keyword ?
Ans: read from main memory for consistency results

Q)Atomic
Ans: atomic ensures indivisibility (the operation itself cannot be interrupted).

Q) Serlization used uuid to serlized and deserlized if any filed is missing but serlized id match it will ignore none
matching keys.
Externalizable --> customized Serlizations
